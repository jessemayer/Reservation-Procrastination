# Reservation-Procrastination
In collaboration with a back-end developer, our objective was to create a streamlined website for securing highly sought-after reservations (fire lookouts, camping, permits, lotteries, tours) on Recreation.gov. Users can book these reservations as soon as they become available, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience.
